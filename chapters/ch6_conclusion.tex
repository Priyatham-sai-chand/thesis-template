\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, the architecture has been effective in sending bulk emails of various volumes with runtime that can be considered as sufficient or optimal and cost-effective. The primary goal of the architecture to be able to manage the entire system without a server being provisioned directly i.e. serverless is achieved and is promising to further develop and enhance its capabilities. The statistics displayed can be used for reach through the customers and the key idea of the architecture is to make use of serverless functions and services to manage emails with an optional fronted interface which was the case in this paper. Thus, making it a fast application to deliver emails to the usersâ€™ inboxes in a short period of time. Without provisioning any IP addresses and acquiring the compute power needed to send the emails beforehand thereby making it more effective and possesses a higher level of abstraction that the conventional method.

\section{Future Scope}

The following architecture has immense scope to be integrated with various other services such as SMS service or can act as an independent backend logic to implement notficiation service to mobile application for the purposes of marketing or sharing information using other means of communication using the same logic with extensions.
